Read through Shepherd, M. D., & van de Sande, C. (2014). Reading mathematics for understanding—From novice to expert. *The Journal of Mathematical Behavior, 35*, 74–86. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmathb.2014.06.003](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmathb.2014.06.003)

> Example of research done comparing novice, intermediate, and expert level learners in mathematics. Focuses more on the expertise approach to reading mathematical text. What I need is research into recognizing the approach to problem solving based upon the “shape” of the presented mathematical material. How can/do experts internalize the relationship between the presented form and class of approaches to problem solving?

A revised review of the literature is warranted.
